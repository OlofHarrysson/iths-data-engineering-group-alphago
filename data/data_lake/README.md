# Data Lake
Any raw/unstructured data goes here.

## More info
A data lake is a centralized repository that stores raw and unstructured data. It is designed to accommodate a wide variety of data types and formats without requiring any predefined schema or organization. In a data lake, data is stored in its native format, allowing for flexible and scalable storage. This raw data can include structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data from various sources.
