  "blog_text": "Data, and more specifically using data, is not a new concept, but it remains an elusive one. It comes with terms like \u201cthe internet of things\u201d (IoT) and \u201cthe cloud,\u201d and no matter how often those are explained, smart people can still be confused. And then there\u2019s the amount of information available and the speed with which it comes in. Software is omnipresent. It\u2019s in coffeemakers and watches, gathering data every second. The question becomes how to take all the new technology and take advantage of the potential insights and analytics. It\u2019s not a small ask.\n\u201cPutting our arms around what digital transformation is can be difficult to do,\u201d says Abel Sanchez. But as the executive director and research director of MIT\u2019s Geospatial Data Center, that\u2019s exactly what he does with his work in helping industries and executives shift their operations in order to make sense of their data and be able to use it to help their bottom lines.\nHandling the pace\nData can lead to making better business decisions. That\u2019s not a new or surprising insight, but as Sanchez says, people still tend to work off of intuition. Part of the problem is that they don\u2019t know what to do with their available data, and there\u2019s usually plenty of available data. Part of that problem is that there\u2019s so much information being produced from so many sources. As soon as a person wakes up and turns on their phone or starts their car, software is running. It\u2019s coming in fast, but because it\u2019s also complex, \u201cit outperforms people,\u201d he says.\nAs an example with Uber, once a person clicks on the app for a ride, predictive models start firing at the rate of 1 million per second. It\u2019s all in order to optimize the trip, taking into account factors such as school schedules, roadway conditions, traffic, and a driver\u2019s availability. It\u2019s helpful for the task, but it\u2019s something that \u201cno human would be able to do,\u201d he says.\u00a0\nThe solution requires a few components. One is a new way to store data. In the past, the classic was creating the \u201cperfect library,\u201d which was too structured. The response to that was to create a \u201cdata lake,\u201d where all the information would go in and somehow people would make sense of it. \u201cThis also failed,\u201d Sanchez says.\nData storage needs to be re-imaged, in which a key element is greater accessibility. In most corporations, only 10-20 percent of employees have the access and technical skill to work with the data. The rest have to go through a centralized resource and get into a queue, an inefficient system. The goal, Sanchez says, is to democratize the information by going to a modern stack, which would convert what he calls \u201cdormant data\u201d into \u201cactive data.\u201d The result? Better decisions could be made.\nThe first, big step companies need to take is the will to make the change. Part of it is an investment of money, but it\u2019s also an attitude shift. Corporations can have an embedded culture where things have always been done a certain way and deviating from that is resisted because it\u2019s different. But when it comes to data, a new approach is needed. Managing and curating the information can no longer rest in the hands of one person with the institutional memory. It\u2019s not possible. It\u2019s also not practical because companies are losing out on efficiency and productivity, because with technology, \u201cWhat use to take years to do, now you can do in days,\u201d Sanchez says.\nThe new player\nThe above exemplifies what\u2019s been involved with coordinating data along four intertwined components: IoT, AI, the cloud, and security. The first two create the information, which then gets stored in the cloud, but it\u2019s all for naught without robust security. But one relative newcomer has come into the picture. It\u2019s blockchain technology, a term that is often said but still not fully understood, adding further to the confusion.\nSanchez says that information has been handled and organized a certain way with the World Wide Web. Blockchain is an opportunity to be more nimble and productive by offering the chance to have an accepted identity, currency, and logic that works on a global scale. The holdup has always been that there\u2019s never been any agreement on those three components on a global scale. It leads to people being shut out, inefficiency, and lost business.\nOne example, Sanchez says, of blockchain\u2019s potential is with hospitals. In the United States, they\u2019re private and information has to be constantly integrated from doctors, insurance companies, labs, government regulators, and pharmaceutical companies. It leads to repeated steps to do something as simple as recognizing a patient\u2019s identity, which often can\u2019t be agreed upon. With blockchain, these various entities can create a consortium using open source code with no barriers of access, and it could quickly and easily identify a patient because it set up an agreement, and with it \u201cremove that level of effort.\u201d It\u2019s an incremental step, but one which can be built upon that reduces cost and risk.\nAnother example \u2014 \u201cone of the best examples,\u201d Sanchez says \u2014 is what was done in Indonesia. Most of the rice, corn, and wheat that comes from this area is produced from smallholder farms. For the people making loans, it\u2019s expensive to understand the risk of cultivating these plots of land. Compounding that is that these farmers don\u2019t have state-issued identities or credit records, so, \u201cThey don\u2019t exist in the modern economic sense,\u201d he says. They don\u2019t have access to loans, and banks are losing out on potential good customers.\nWith this project, blockchain allowed local people to gather information about the farms on their smartphones. Banks could acquire the information and compensate the people with tokens, thereby incentivizing the work. The bank would see the creditworthiness of the farms, and farmers could end up getting fair loans.\nIn the end, it creates a beneficial circle for the banks, farmers, and community, but it also represents what can be done with digital transformation by allowing businesses to optimize their processes, make better decisions, and ultimately profit.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tremendous new platform,\u201d Sanchez says. \u201cThis is the promise.\u201d\n",
