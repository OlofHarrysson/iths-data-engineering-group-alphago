  "blog_text": "In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the word \u201cviral\u201d has a new resonance, and it\u2019s not necessarily positive. Ruha Benjamin, a scholar who investigates the social dimensions of science, medicine, and technology, advocates a shift in perspective. She thinks justice can also be contagious. That\u2019s the premise of Benjamin\u2019s award-winning book \u201cViral Justice: How We Grow the World We Want,\u201d as she shared with MIT Libraries staff on a June 14 visit.\u00a0\n\u201cIf this pandemic has taught us anything, it's that something almost undetectable can be deadly, and that we can transmit it without even knowing,\u201d said Benjamin, professor of African American studies at Princeton University. \u201cDoesn't this imply that small things, seemingly minor actions, decisions, or habits, could have exponential effects in the other direction, tipping the scales towards justice?\u201d\u00a0\nTo seek a more just world, Benjamin exhorted library staff to notice the ways exclusion is built into our daily lives, showing examples of park benches with armrests at regular intervals. On the surface they appear welcoming, but they also make lying down \u2014 or sleeping \u2014 impossible. This idea is taken to the extreme with \u201cPay and Sit,\u201d an art installation by Fabian Brunsing in the form of a bench that deploys sharp spikes on the seat if the user doesn\u2019t pay a meter. It serves as a powerful metaphor for discriminatory design.\u00a0\n\u201cDr. Benjamin\u2019s keynote was seriously mind-blowing,\u201d said Cherry Ibrahim, human resources generalist in the MIT Libraries. \u201cOne part that really grabbed my attention was when she talked about benches purposely designed to prevent unhoused people from sleeping on them. There are these hidden spikes in our community that we might not even realize because they don't directly impact us.\u201d\u00a0\nBenjamin urged the audience to look for those \u201cspikes,\u201d which new technologies can make even more insidious \u2014 gender and racial bias in facial recognition, the use of racial data in software used to predict student success, algorithmic bias in health care \u2014 often in the guise of progress. She coined the term \u201cthe New Jim Code\u201d to describe the combination of coded bias and the imagined objectivity we ascribe to technology.\u00a0\n\u201cAt the MIT Libraries, we\u2019re deeply concerned with combating inequities through our work, whether it\u2019s democratizing access to data or investigating ways disparate communities can participate in scholarship with minimal bias or barriers,\u201d says Director of Libraries Chris Bourg. \u201cIt\u2019s our mission to remove the \u2018spikes\u2019 in the systems through which we create, use, and share knowledge.\u201d\nCalling out the harms encoded into our digital world is critical, argues Benjamin, but we must also create alternatives. This is where the collective power of individuals can be transformative. Benjamin shared examples of those who are \u201cre-imagining the default settings of technology and society,\u201d citing initiatives like Data for Black Lives movement and the Detroit Community Technology Project. \u201cI'm interested in the way that everyday people are changing the digital ecosystem and demanding different kinds of rights and responsibilities and protections,\u201d she said.\nIn 2020, Benjamin founded the Ida B. Wells Just Data Lab with a goal of bringing together students, educators, activists, and artists to develop a critical and creative approach to data conception, production, and circulation. Its projects have examined different aspects of data and racial inequality: assessing the impact of Covid-19 on student learning; providing resources that confront the experience of Black mourning, grief, and mental health; or developing a playbook for Black maternal mental health. Through the lab\u2019s student-led projects Benjamin sees the next generation re-imagining technology in ways that respond to the needs of marginalized people.\n\u201cIf inequity is woven into the very fabric of our society \u2014 we see it from policing to education to health care to work \u2014 then each twist, coil, and code is a chance for us to weave new patterns, practices, and politics,\u201d she said. \u201cThe vastness of the problems that we're up against will be their undoing.\u201d\n",
