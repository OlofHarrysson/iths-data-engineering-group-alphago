  "blog_text": "When Erik Duhaime PhD \u201919 was working on his thesis in MIT\u2019s Center for Collective Intelligence, he noticed his wife, then a medical student, spending hours studying on apps that offered flash cards and quizzes. His research had shown that, as a group, medical students could classify skin lesions more accurately than professional dermatologists; the trick was to continually measure each student\u2019s performance on cases with known answers, throw out the opinions of people who were bad at the task, and intelligently pool the opinions of people that were good.\nCombining his wife\u2019s studying habits with his research, Duhaime founded Centaur Labs, a company that created a mobile app called DiagnosUs to gather the opinions of medical experts on real-world scientific and biomedical data. Through the app, users review anything from images of potentially cancerous skin lesions or audio clips of heart and lung sounds that could indicate a problem. If the users are accurate, Centaur uses their opinions and awards them small cash prizes. Those opinions, in turn, help medical AI companies train and improve their algorithms.\nThe approach combines the desire of medical experts to hone their skills with the desperate need for well-labeled medical data by companies using AI for biotech, developing pharmaceuticals, or commercializing medical devices.\n\u201cI realized my wife\u2019s studying could be productive work for AI developers,\u201d Duhaime recalls. \u201cToday we have tens of thousands of people using our app, and about half are medical students who are blown away that they win money in the process of studying. So, we have this gamified platform where people are competing with each other to train data and winning money if they\u2019re good and improving their skills at the same time \u2014 and by doing that they are labeling data for teams building life saving AI.\u201d\nGamifying medical labeling\nDuhaime completed his PhD under Thomas Malone, the Patrick J. McGovern Professor of Management and founding director of the Center for Collective Intelligence.\n\u201cWhat interested me was the wisdom of crowds phenomenon,\u201d Duhaime says. \u201cAsk a bunch of people how many jelly beans are in a jar, and the average of everybody\u2019s answer is pretty close. I was interested in how you navigate that problem in a task that requires skill or expertise. Obviously you don\u2019t just want to ask a bunch of random people if you have cancer, but at the same time, we know that second opinions in health care can be extremely valuable. You can think of our platform as a supercharged way of getting a second opinion.\u201d\nDuhaime began exploring ways to leverage collective intelligence to improve medical diagnoses. In one experiment, he trained groups of lay people and medical school students that he describes as \u201csemiexperts\u201d to classify skin conditions, finding that by combining the opinions of the highest performers he could outperform professional dermatologists. He also found that by combining algorithms trained to detect skin cancer with the opinions of experts, he could outperform either method on its own.\n\u201cThe core insight was you do two things,\u201d Duhaime explains. \u201cThe first thing is to measure people\u2019s performance \u2014 which sounds obvious, but even in the medical domain it isn\u2019t done much. If you ask a dermatologist if they\u2019re good, they say, \u2018Yeah of course, I\u2019m a dermatologist.\u2019 They don\u2019t necessarily know how good they are at specific tasks. The second thing is that when you get multiple opinions, you need to identify complementarities between the different people. You need to recognize that expertise is multidimensional, so it\u2019s a little more like putting together the optimal trivia team than it is getting the five people who are all the best at the same thing. For example, one dermatologist might be better at identifying melanoma, whereas another might be better at classifying the severity of psoriasis.\u201d\nWhile still pursuing his PhD, Duhaime founded Centaur and began using MIT\u2019s entrepreneurial ecosystem to further develop the idea. He received funding from MIT\u2019s Sandbox Innovation Fund in 2017 and participated in the delta v startup accelerator run by the Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship over the summer of 2018. The experience helped him get into the prestigious Y Combinator accelerator later that year.\nThe DiagnosUs app, which Duhaime developed with Centaur co-founders Zach Rausnitz and Tom Gellatly, is designed to help users test and improve their skills. Duhaime says about half of users are medical school students and the other half are mostly doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals.\n\u201cIt\u2019s better than studying for exams, where you might have multiple choice questions,\u201d Duhaime says. \u201cThey get to see actual cases and practice.\u201d\nCentaur gathers millions of opinions every week from tens of thousands of people around the world. Duhaime says most people earn coffee money, although the person who\u2019s earned the most from the platform is a doctor in eastern Europe who\u2019s made around $10,000.\n\u201cPeople can do it on the couch, they can do it on the T,\u201d Duhaime says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like work \u2014 it\u2019s fun.\u201d\nThe approach stands in sharp contrast to traditional data labeling and AI content moderation, which are typically outsourced to low-resource countries.\nCentaur\u2019s approach produces accurate results, too. In a paper with researchers from Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), and Eindhoven University of Technology, Centaur showed its crowdsourced opinions labeled lung ultrasounds as reliably as experts did. Another study with researchers at Memorial Sloan Kettering showed crowdsourced labeling of dermoscopic images was more accurate than that of highly experienced dermatologists. Beyond images, Centaur\u2019s platform also works with video, audio, text from sources like research papers or anonymized conversations between doctors and patients, and waves from electroencephalograms (EEGs) and electrocardiographys (ECGs).\nFinding the experts\nCentaur has found that the best performers come from surprising places. In 2021, to collect expert opinions on EEG patterns, researchers held a contest through the DiagnosUs app at a conference featuring about 50 epileptologists, each with more than 10 years of experience. The organizers made a custom shirt to give to the contest\u2019s winner, who they assumed would be in attendance at the conference.\nBut when the results came in, a pair of medical students in Ghana, Jeffery Danquah and Andrews Gyabaah, had beaten everyone in attendance. The highest-ranked conference attendee had come in ninth.\n\u201cI started by doing it for the money, but I realized it actually started helping me a lot,\u201d Gyabaah told Centaur\u2019s team later. \u201cThere were times in the clinic where I realized that I was doing better than others because of what I learned on the DiagnosUs app.\u201d\nAs AI continues to change the nature of work, Duhaime believes Centaur Labs will be used as an ongoing check on AI models.\n\u201cRight now, we\u2019re helping people train algorithms primarily, but increasingly I think we\u2019ll be used for monitoring algorithms and in conjunction with algorithms, basically serving as the humans in the loop for a range of tasks,\u201d Duhaime says. \u201cYou might think of us less as a way to train AI and more as a part of the full life cycle, where we\u2019re providing feedback on models\u2019 outputs or monitoring the model.\u201d\nDuhaime sees the work of humans and AI algorithms becoming increasingly integrated and believes Centaur Labs has an important role to play in that future.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just train algorithm, deploy algorithm,\u201d Duhaime says. \u201cInstead, there will be these digital assembly lines all throughout the economy, and you need on-demand expert human judgment infused in different places along the value chain.\u201d\n",
